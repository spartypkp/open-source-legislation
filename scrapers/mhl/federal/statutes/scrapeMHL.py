Extract the Title this legislation is organized under. This will almost always be near the top of the page and be in the format \"TITLE # - NAME\". Extract separately the title number and title name into variables called \"title_num\" and \"title_name\". Repeat this for the \"chapter_num\" and \"chapter_name\" as well.\n2.

Sections are always going to be the bottom most level of organization. Between titles/chapters and sections are some level identifiers used to group and organize sections. Depending on the table of contents, you may see \"Article\", \"Division\", or \"Part\". Take some time to understand the level identifier, which will be referred to as LEVEL. Although these level identifiers may have different names based on the specific table of contents, they all follow the same rules. Their parents are the overall title/chapter, and their children are always sections.\n3.
